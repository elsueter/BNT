	abstract = {This chapter describes biological backgrounds of regulatory relationships in living cells, high-throughput experimental technologies, and application of computational approaches in reverse engineering of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated and gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The most commonly used models for GRNs inference based on Boolean networks, Bayesian networks, dynamic Bayesian networks, association networks, novel two-stage model using integration of a priori biological knowledge, differential and difference equations models are detailed and their inference capabilities are compared. The regulatory role of miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) in miRNAs-mediated regulatory networks is described as well. Additionally, commonly used methods for target prediction of miRNAs and TFs are described as well as most commonly used biological regulatory relationships databases and tools are listed. The mainly validation criteria used for assessment of inferred regulatory networks are explained. Finally, concluding remarks and further directions for miRNA-mediated and GRNs inference are given.},

	abstract = {Investigation of the gene's long-term behavior becomes more important in understanding the interactions between different genes and how the genes collectively behave. It has been known for a long time by biologists that some genes may have more impact than others in determining the value of a target gene. Probabilistic Boolean genetic regulatory networks (PBNs), the stochastic generalizations of Boolean networks, have been used in system biology to study biological systems from a holistic perspective in providing a comprehensive, system-level understanding of cellular behavior. Hence, finding the genes that have the most potent effect is an important task in studying the PBN. Similarly, some genes may be more stable while other genes have little effect. However, current computational methods for analyzing the long-term behavior of genes require the construction of the network's transition probability matrix, which has a huge size of 2n Ã— 2n where n is the number of genes on the PBN. That said, even a PBN with a small set of 20 genes would require memory surpassing the size of any computer system. We present an algebraic method for direct computation of the long-term influence, sensitivity, and impact factor of genes in a PBN. Our novel method only requires O(n2) memory space --- a significant improvement in term of space as well as time complexity. We are able to analyze the long-term behavior of genes in artificial PBNs with 500 genes within minutes on a desktop computer. We compare our novel method with previously known methods and report experimental results to illustrate our theoretical arguments. Our method enables the calculation of likelihood of the occurrence of certain events of interest, thus allowing quantitative statements to be made about the system's behavior, expressed as probabilities or expectations of biological systems.},

	abstract = {Boolean networks with asynchronous updates are a class of logical models particularly well adapted to describe the dynamics of biological networks with uncertain measures. The state space of these models can be described by an asynchronous state transition graph, which represents all the possible exits from every single state, and gives a global image of all the possible trajectories of the system. In addition, the asynchronous state transition graph can be associated with an absorbing Markov chain, further providing a semi-quantitative framework where it becomes possible to compute probabilities for the different trajectories. For large networks, however, such direct analyses become computationally untractable, given the exponential dimension of the graph. Exploiting the general modularity of biological systems, we have introduced the novel concept of asymptotic graph, computed as an interconnection of several asynchronous transition graphs and recovering all asymptotic behaviors of a large interconnected system from the behavior of its smaller modules. From a modeling point of view, the interconnection of networks is very useful to address for instance the interplay between known biological modules and to test different hypotheses on the nature of their mutual regulatory links. This paper develops two new features of this general methodology: a quantitative dimension is added to the asymptotic graph, through the computation of relative probabilities for each final attractor and a companion cross-graph is introduced to complement the method on a theoretical point of view.},
